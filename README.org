This package provides commands to conveniently show Org headings in a sidebar window while you're working on them.  A heading in one of your Org files is defined as the "now" heading, and other headings are refiled to it with one command, and back to their original location with another.

The sidebar window is an indirect buffer created with =org-tree-to-indirect-buffer=, so you can work in it as you would a normal buffer.  Being a special Emacs side window, it's persistent, resisting being closed by accident by window management commands.

Note that this package adds Org UUIDs to entries in property drawers when they are refiled, to ensure they are tracked properly while they're being moved.

* Screenshots

There's nothing special about the appearance of this package's functionality.  But here are two example screenshots.

By default, the sidebar's outline is shown at level 2, so the "now" heading should be a top-level heading:

The sidebar is just an Org buffer, so you can expand it, type into it, etc:

* Installation

Install these required packages:

+ [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]]

Then put =org-now.el= in your ~load-path~, and put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'org-now)
#+END_SRC

Here's a configuration with mnemonic keybindings that you may find convenient, using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] and [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package org-now
    :general (:keymaps 'org-mode-map
                       :prefix "M-SPC"
                       "rl" #'org-now-link
                       "rn" #'org-now-refile-to-now
                       "rp" #'org-now-refile-to-previous-location))
#+END_SRC

* Usage

When using ~org-now~ for the first time, you'll be prompted to configure the =org-now-location= setting to point to a place in one of your Org files where you want to temporarily refile "now" tasks.

*Commands:*

-  ~org-now-link~ :: Add a link to the entry at point to the =org-now= buffer.  This command works in any buffer that ~org-store-link~ can store a link for, not just in Org buffers.
-  ~org-now-refile-to-now~ :: Refile entry at point to the =org-now= buffer.
-  ~org-now-refile-to-previous-location~ :: Refile entry in =org-now= buffer back to its original location.
-  ~org-now~ :: Show the =org-now= sidebar window, or select it if it's already open.  (The other commands do this automatically.)

** Hook examples

The ~org-now-hook~ option can be used to run user-defined functions after the =org-now= buffer is created.  Here are two examples you might find useful.

+ Disable mode-line ::
   If you don't need or want the mode-line in the sidebar window, this function will disable it.  In this case, it's recommended to use something like ~real-auto-save-mode~ in Org buffers to ensure that refiled headings are automatically saved to disk, because you won't be able to see the buffer's modified status.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (lambda ()
    (setq mode-line-format nil))
#+END_SRC

+ Set =org-level-1= heading to 10 point size ::
   This is helpful when your =org-now-location= is a file, in which case headings will be top-level headings.  This function can be used to reduce the font size so the headings fit better in the sidebar window.  It works especially well if your =org-level-= faces each inherit from their higher-level face (i.e. =org-level-2= inherits from =org-level-1=, etc.).

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (lambda ()
    (face-remap-add-relative 'org-level-1 '(:height 100)))
#+END_SRC
