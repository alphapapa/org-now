;;; org-now.el --- Conveniently show current tasks in a sidebar  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; URL: http://github.com/alphapapa/org-now
;; Version: 0.1-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1") (dash))
;; Keywords: org

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides commands to conveniently show Org headings in a sidebar
;; window while you're working on them.  A heading in one of your Org files is
;; defined as the "now" heading, and other headings are refiled to it with one
;; command, and back to their original location with another.

;; The sidebar window is an indirect buffer created with
;; `org-tree-to-indirect-buffer', so you can work in it as you would a normal
;; buffer.  Being a special Emacs side window, it's persistent, resisting being
;; closed by accident by window management commands.

;; Note that this package adds Org UUIDs to entries in property drawers when
;; they are refiled, to ensure they are tracked properly while they're being
;; moved.

;;;; Installation

;;;;; MELPA

;; If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

;;;;; Manual

;; Install these required packages:

;; + dash

;; Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init
;; file:

;; (require 'org-now)

;;;; Usage

;; 1.  Run the command `org-now' to show the sidebar.  You'll be prompted to
;;     configure the `org-now-location' setting to point to a heading in one of your
;;     Org files where you want to temporarily refile "now" tasks.
;; 2.  Refile tasks to the "now" buffer with the command `org-now-refile-to-now.'
;; 3.  Move tasks back to their original location with the command
;;     `org-now-refile-to-previous-location.'
